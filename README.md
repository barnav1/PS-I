# PS-I: Temperature Control

This repository contains all work related to my project under the Practice School 1 program.

The script `fetch_data.py` uses Meteostat to obtain hourly temperature data for Hyderabad, which is saved in `temperature_data.csv`. Meteostat is an open vendor of weather and climate data.
